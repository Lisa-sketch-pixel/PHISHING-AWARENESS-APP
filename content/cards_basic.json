    "content": "Phishing is when scammers pretend to be trusted organizations (like your bank or school) to trick you into sharing personal information such as passwords or card numbers. Example: You get an email that says 'Your account is locked — click here to verify your details'. It looks real, but the link leads to a fake site."

  {
    "title": "Spotting Suspicious Emails",
    "content": "Look for red flags like urgency ('Act now!'), bad grammar, strange sender addresses (support@bank-secure-login.co instead of bank.com), or offers that seem too good to be true. Always stop and think before clicking any link."

  {
    "title": "Links & Domain Tricks",
    "content": "Phishers use similar-looking websites. Example: paypa1.com or mybank-login.net instead of the real domain. Always hover your mouse over links to preview the real URL before clicking."

    "title": "Attachments & Downloads",
    "content": "Never open unexpected attachments — especially ZIP, EXE, or HTML files. Example: an email pretending to be 'Invoice.pdf' might actually hide malware. If unsure, confirm with the sender through another channel."

    "content": "Legitimate companies will never ask for your password, 2FA code, or credit card details through email. Always sign in through official apps or websites, not links in emails."
